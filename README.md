# quiz-game

## Description

My motivation was to create a quiz game with a decent UI experience. I built this project so that I could get a more in-depth understanding of JavaScript.
this solves an issue with making websites with only html and css. I used for loops and traversing to create most of this website. I learned how to create HTML elements in automated way with JavaScript.
